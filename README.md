An attempt to continue from an older scratch project. The idea was to make a capture the flag game.

I think I got caught up in making little details work as opposed to actually developing something like a game. It turns out that trying to write a game engine from nothing is a little hard.

However, this is still something I have spent a lot of time trying to make.
